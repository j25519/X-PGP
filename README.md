# X PGP

Basically a Temu Keyoxide.

Have yet to add vertification of cryptographic proofs like Keyoxide has, but it will show metadata attached to a PGP key in a format that *should* be compatible with keys using Keyoxide's format.

May or may not get maintained. No guarantees provided. Only as secure as the server/computer you run it on. Never upload your private key.
